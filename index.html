      Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take
      a flower and tear its petals, <br />
      saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:<br />
      <br />
      I love you<br />
      a little<br />
      a lot<br />
      passionately<br />
      madly<br />
      not at all<br />
      When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams,
      surging thoughts and emotions.<br />
      <br />
      Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say
      for a flower of a given <br />
      number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.<br />
